# Amazon Vine Review Analysis
03 Oct 2021

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize PySpark in an effort to analyze data obtained from Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program, which is a service that allows vendors to receive reviews on their product; video games were selected as the product in question. PySpark was first used to perform the ETL process to extract and transform, connect to AWS, and then the transformed data was loaded into pgAdmin. Following this, PySpark was again used to determine if there is bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.
